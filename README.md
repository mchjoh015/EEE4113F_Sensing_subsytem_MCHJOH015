Radar Detection System
This repository contains the complete software and resources for a radar-based detection system. The project uses an ESP32 microcontroller, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and a servo motor (SG90) to scan for objects in a 180¬∞ arc and display detections on a real-time graphical radar interface.

Project Structure
The repository is divided into the following key sections:

1. Arduino Sensor Code
Platform: ESP32 (Arduino IDE)

Function: Controls the SG90 servo motor to sweep across a 180¬∞ range and back.

Sensor Integration: Uses the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of objects at various angles during the sweep.

Output: Sends angle and distance measurements for radar visualization.

Note: Includes embedded WiFi connection code to transmit data over a network.

2. WiFi Connection Code (Standalone Test)
Purpose: Verifies WiFi connectivity of the ESP32 module.

Usage: Provided separately to test and debug network issues.

Note: This functionality is already integrated into the Arduino Sensor Code but is available here for standalone testing.

3. Radar GUI Code
Function: Implements a radar-like graphical user interface (GUI) on a computer.

Features:

Displays real-time angle and distance of detected objects.

Calibrated to visually represent object positions accurately.

Language/Framework: [Specify language used, e.g., Python + Tkinter/Processing/etc.]

4. CAD Files
Contents: 3D model of the sensor housing used to mount the servo and ultrasonic sensor.

Format: [Specify format, e.g., .STL, .F3D, etc.]

Purpose: Provides mechanical design support for physical assembly.
